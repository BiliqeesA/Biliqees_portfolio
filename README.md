# MICROSOFT EXCEL PROJECT — COMPANY LAYOFFS

This is my first project since I started my data analysis journey, and this was done using Microsoft Excel. I browsed the Kaggle website and came across the dataset on layoffs. I wouldn’t have considered working on this as my project if Meta’s recent layoff due to the slowdown in the economy hadn’t happened.

**ABOUT THE DATASET**

The dataset is a CSV file obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022) and includes layoffs of employees across various industries from COVID-19 to the present. The dataset consists of 9 columns: company (name of the company), location (location of the layoff), industry (industry of the company), total laid off (number of employees laid off), percentage laid off (percentage of employees laid off), date (date of the layoff), stage (stage of funding), country, and funds raised (funds raised by the company).
